# A System of Legacy Systems

When I started on this project, there was a team of 4 developers tasked with developing a management portal for grievance, complaints and suggestions.

<blockquote class="accent-light-bg text-center">
	<strong>Main Page</strong>
       <row>
                <center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/temple/old-as.png" alt="Main Page"></center>
                </row>
                </blockquote>

# Less is More

Each of these sites can contain 100s of pages, many of which contain outdated, hard-to-find, or duplicated information that is up-to-date elsewhere. Additionally, we have found that the content of most of these sites were did not contain what people were looking for. 

![People go to the website because they can't wait for the next alumni magazine, right? What do you mean, you want a campus map? One of our students made one as a CS class project back in '01!  You can click to zoom and everything!](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/university_website.png)
