# FSEV

FSEV is a worldwide competition consisting of several teams made up of college students. In this vastly competitive league, teams of 3-6 develop cars utilizing CAD and other related tools. However, the complexity of what we do reaches beyond mere engineering and into fields of business/marketing, graphic design, and possibly most importantly if considering real-world application, team management and cooperation. Then, each of these skill sets developed throughout the team process is put to the test at regional, national, and world level competitions. As a result, FSEV has created a system which effectively develops and enhances studentsâ€™ learning experience through their interests as well as by teaching necessary real-world situations/applications.
